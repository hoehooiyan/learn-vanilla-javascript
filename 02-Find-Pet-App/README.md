# Project Details

Use the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs) to get a list of available pets from a shelter and display them on a web page.

**Bonus:** Dynamically create filters for things like age, gender, breed, and type of animal, and let users filter out pets that don't match their criteria.

*__Quick heads up:__ The Petfinder API is buggy and poorly maintained, so you may run into some hiccups along the way.*

## Considerations

- How will you display pet images?
- Will you convert any links in the content into working URLs? If so, how?
- Will you display the full profile text for each pet on one page, or let users dig into a more detailed view?
